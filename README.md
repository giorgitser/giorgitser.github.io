<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when
academic computer scientists began designing simple games and simulations
as part of their research or just for recreation. At M.I.T in the 1960s,
professors and students played games such as 3D tic-tac-toe and Moon Landing.
These games were played on computers such as the IBM 1560, and moves were
made by means of punch cards. Video gaming did not reach mainstream
popularity until the 1970s and 1980s. Video gaming improved so much
and became so popular in modern world that, almost everybody
enjoys and having their own private space to play their own video game.
Ages 5-19 are probably the most gaming group ages, even though age does
not matter, because there are tons of adults that video game. Here on my
website i would like to show you guys the different systems that i prefer 
for you to game with.</p>
